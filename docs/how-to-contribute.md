# How to Contribute

## Start Contributing

TM1py is an open-source project. It thrives on contributions from the TM1 community. If you find a bug or feel like you can contribute a missing feature, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the [TM1py GitHub repository](https://github.com/cubewise-code/tm1py).
2. **Make Your Changes**: Update the code to fix the bug or add your feature.
3. **Create a Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, create a pull request so we can review and merge them.

## Code Style and Linting

To ensure consistency across the codebase, we use the following tools:

- **[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)**: An auto-formatter for Python code. Please format your code using Black before submitting a pull request.
- **[Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/)**: A fast Python linter. Make sure your code passes all linting checks.

## Editor Integration

Both **Black** and **Ruff** have excellent integrations with popular editors like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). Setting up these tools in your editor ensures that your code is automatically formatted and linted as you work.
